How to use ?
- During the first launch you'll have to specify:
      an activation password (case in-sensitive)
      the phone number on which you wish to receive the location by text messages (make sure you have unlimited text)
      the interval of localisation updating

- To activate the service just text the phone (where AntiTheft is installed) with the activation password you choose
during the setup, you'll receive a text with a Google Maps link with the current phone location.

- To stop the service just send "STOP" and the activation password (separated by a blank)
